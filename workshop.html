                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>We recently conducted a two-day hands-on workshop at Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College titled
                        <b>“Designing Smart Systems: Bridging Electronics and IoT”</b>. The workshop was designed to
                        help
                        students understand how modern intelligent systems are built starting from embedded hardware
                        fundamentals to implementing real-time IoT applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>Students were introduced to the fundamentals of the IoT ecosystem, embedded systems,
                        microcontrollers, and real-time applications, gaining a clear understanding of how connected
                        devices operate. They also explored Edge IoT and AIoT, learning how intelligence can run
                        directly on devices to enable faster and smarter decision-making.
                    </p>
                    <p>The workshop then moved into a fully practical phase, where students worked with the ESP32
                        microcontroller, interfaced sensors, wrote embedded code, installed drivers, and practiced
                        hardware debugging. This hands-on experience helped them translate the concepts into real
                        applications and understand how smart systems are built.

                    </div>
                    <p>We focused on building a complete understanding of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its role in
                        modern technology. Students were introduced to how IoT systems function end-to-end, from sensing
                        and data acquisition to connectivity, cloud processing, and intelligent automation.</p>

                    <p>The session covered:<br>
                        <b>IoT architecture</b> (Device layer, Connectivity layer, Cloud platform and Application layer)
                        <b>Communication technologies</b> (Wi-Fi, BLE, LoRa, cellular IoT)
                        <b>IoT protocols</b> (MQTT, HTTP/REST, CoAP).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Real-world applications across industries such as smart homes, healthcare, agriculture,
                        wearables, and industrial automation.

                        Along with the technical concepts, we also discussed how students can build a strong career in
                        the IoT domain. They were guided on essential skills such as embedded programming,
                        microcontroller fundamentals, sensor integration, networking concepts, cloud platforms, and the
                        growing importance of AI and data analysis. We talked about the value of hands-on projects,
                        internships, open-source contributions.

                    <p>During the workshop, we had the opportunity to deliver an in-depth session on AIoT, exploring how
                        artificial intelligence seamlessly integrates with Internet of Things to create intelligent,
                        autonomous systems. We introduced students to the concept of machine learning models deployed on
                        edge devices, enabling real-time decision-making and predictive analytics without constant cloud
                        dependency.
                    </p>
                    <p>The session covered how edge computing processes data locally on devices like ESP32
                        microcontrollers, reducing latency and improving response times for critical applications. We
                        explained practical use cases across agriculture, healthcare, and industrial sectors where AIoT
                        is driving innovation from predictive maintenance in factories to livestock health monitoring on
                        farms.
                    </p>
                    <p>Students learned how ML algorithms analyze sensor data to detect patterns, make
                        autonomous decisions, and trigger intelligent actions automatically. The enthusiasm and
                        engagement throughout the session demonstrated their grasp of how AI and IoT together create the
                        future of smart systems.

                    </div>
                    <p>We focused on building a strong foundation in embedded systems. Students were introduced to the
                        core building blocks of modern electronics microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and
                        communication interfaces. The session covered how embedded systems operate in real-time
                        environments, how firmware interacts with hardware, and how these systems form the backbone of
                        today's smart devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>Concepts such as GPIO control, timers, interrupts, memory architecture, and peripheral
                        communication (I2C, SPI, UART) were explained with practical examples. Students gained a clear
                        understanding of how hardware and software integrate to create intelligent, responsive
                        electronic systems.
                    </p>
                    <p>A fully hands-on experience using the ESP32, one of the most versatile microcontrollers for IoT
                        development. Students learned how to interface different sensors and collect real-time data,
                        followed by writing firmware to process and display the information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Practical exercises included reading temperature and weight sensors, controlling peripherals
                        through code. Students also implemented debugging techniques, understood pin configurations, and
                        learned best practices for writing clean and efficient embedded code.
                        Their enthusiasm throughout the exercises made the workshop engaging and highly productive.
